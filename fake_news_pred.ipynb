As of next Monday, there will be no limit on such goods brought in by travellers until the end of the year. Thousands took to the streets on Sunday in protests over food and medicine shortages, price increases and the governments handling of Covid-19. One demand they had was for people arriving in Cuba to bring in supplies without paying customs duties. Dozens have been arrested nationwide since the unrest began on Sunday. Authorities confirmed on Tuesday that one man had died. Unauthorised demonstrations are illegal in the country, and anti-government protests are rare.']\n","\n","#cleaning\n","news = [stemming(news[0])]\n","\n","#tokenizing the data\n","news = vectorizer.transform(news)\n","\n","#predicting\n","print(model_logistic_regression.predict(news))"],"execution_count":49,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["[1]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Z_h3FQD_vj1h"},"source":["##Acknowledgments\n","\n","####Project 4.
